            It would technically be a lot neater to use html5 header tag
            but this prac specifically asked me to use a least one id.
            thus this monstrosity was born. in all honesty.
            with html5 there are a lot of things I have done with div here
            that would be simply better with html5 tags but thats how it goes.
            It does make a certain amount of sense though this early in web-dev
            to focus on id and class, rather than going into semantic tags.
            While I am sure I could find some palces to put a class or two if I
            used semantic tags, I doubt I would be able to fit in an id. I would rather
            use semantic tags all the way if I used rather than only some of them, thus
            I go full on div. doing <header id="header> is just stupid after all.
            With that said, I do not like forcing anything in that I dont feel should be
            there, thus puttin in random divs for the express purpose of using id would
            pain my soul. Same goes for mixing semantic tags and class/id where semantic
            tags would have been enough, its about standardization, its been hammered into
            the forementioned soul in my previous university after all.
            thus we go div with class/id route

            I originally intended to use id for each of the top level divs but ended up using
            the class you see below. main reason was that they all used the same design anyway,
            or lack thereof, its all grey, rounded rectangles!
            Anyway, I ended up lacking an id, and thus the header became the perfect scapegoat
            as its the only thing on top level that would not follow the same design as the content
            divs. so I shoved it into a div and id'd it header
            
            Colorscheme. html bg is white, because I personally believe it always should be
            or a very, very light grey, or a very, very white beige.
            You might notice, I am a big fan of light colors with dark, subtle, details.
            There is no question that professionals can make gorgeous looking websites
            with even lighter colors and such, but honestly, I am not that good.
            I know the sort of designs I like, and if I had rememvered how to css before
            I had finished half the design I would have done it differently, but its not like it
            looks bad, its just not what I would call idea.

                WARNING: PENT UP STRESS OVER TECHNOLOGICALLY INEPT BRITISH BANKS BEING VENTED!!!

                Reason I am disdaining letters is because I lived in the UK for a while and,
                while I am not sure if all banks there do this, the one I used did, which I
                recently discovered. To close an account in said bank, I either have to go to
                the local branch where I live and close my account, the easiest way, if you live
                in the united kingdom, or send them a letter... A LETTER! 
                You have absolutely no idea how absolutely fantastic it is to live in Norway
                before you try to live somewhere else for an extended period of time.
                I am dead certain I could close my bank account in Norway remotely. I haven't
                tried, but I refuse to belive they would try to make me send them a letter if
                I for some reason could not go to the bank.

                Why do I hate letters so much? Because I see no reason they should still exist
                when e-mails are a thing that does. Sure, they might need my signature or something
                but here in Norway, at the very least, we have something called electronic signature
                why is this too hard for for something as major as a british bank to accomplish? WHY!

                Sure, letters can be cute if you want to send someone a christmas card,
                or a birthday card, but that's my bottomline. for everything else, e-mails are not
                only better, but more efficient, not to mention, you know, much more certainly than
                with letters, that they will reach their destination, in most cases immediately.

                    Rør &amp; Rot er veldig flinke til det dei driver med. Hadde problemer
                    med røtter i røra, men ikkje no lenger. veit ikkje om det er fordi
                    dei ikkje har kunder eller om dei bare er effektive, men det tok
                    ikkje lange tida ifra bestilling fram til dei kom og banka på døra.
                    prisen var god også, veldig fornøyd.

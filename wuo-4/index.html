        <!--I had source for js function at one point, but I think I closed the tab accidentally and
            I am now completely incapable of finding it again, only thing I did was change the function
            name to to getBrowser and changed alert(x); to return x; All I know is that it was on
            stackoverflow. Problem is just that there are too many people there asking the exact same
            question, since it is not as straightforward as one would think.
            I am certain that at one point in time, navigator.appName would return the correct browser
            but now, I am pretty sure no matter which browser you use, appName will always return Netscape
            and appCodeName will always return mozilla. If you use navigator.userAgent, the correct broweser
            name will show up, but I am not good enough with regex to strip away all the superfluous... stuff
            if that is even possible. As I said, not very experienced with regex.
